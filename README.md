# Basic File Handling in Python

In this introductory minicourse I teach some basics of file handling in Python through the execution of a simple project.

Although the files used in this project may make more sense for people who work in the computational science field (since they are files for molecular representation), the content of the minicourse can be applied by everyone, because I'll teach things such as reading/writing files, selecting specific lines or columns from the files and text formatting.

The project consists in writing a simple script that automatically converts all files from one format (".gen") to another (".xyz"). All video lectures of this course are on my YouTube channel, which you can access [clicking here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc2UL5NUdmTGhxzqb4aJU5IHiWP-IUmT3), and they are recorded in Portuguese. Next, you can see the sequence of videos and the links for accessing them:
